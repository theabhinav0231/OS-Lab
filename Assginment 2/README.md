# OS Lab Assignment 2 - System Startup & Process Simulation

## Description
Python implementation of a basic system startup and process simulation using multiprocessing, logging, and time modules as per ENCS351 Operating Systems lab requirements.

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Task 1: System startup sequence simulation
- ✅ Task 2: Process creation using multiprocessing.Process()
- ✅ Task 3: Dummy task execution using time.sleep()
- ✅ Task 4: Logging of process lifecycle into process_log.txt
- ✅ Task 5: Proper shutdown using join() for process synchronization

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Windows / Linux / macOS
- Ability to generate process_log.txt in the working directory

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Run the program
python3 system_simulation.py
