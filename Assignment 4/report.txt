OPERATING SYSTEMS LAB REPORT - ASSIGNMENT 4

The objective of this assignment is to develop an automated Python script that sequentially performs operating system auditing tasks without user intervention. The specific goals are:

To automatically fetch Process Control Block (PCB) data.

To perform a silent background check for Virtual Machine (VM) signatures.

To programmatically create, modify, and delete files to test file system permissions and operations.

To recursively traverse directory structures and generate a tree view log.

THEORY & CONCEPTS

2.1 Automated System Auditing
Automation in OS contexts allows for rapid deployment of checks across multiple servers. Instead of manual interaction, scripts use standard APIs to gather data.

2.2 System Fingerprinting

Kernel Stats: Using platform.uname() to identify the OS kernel version and architecture.

MAC OUI Analysis: Identifying hardware vendors (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) via the first 24 bits of the MAC address.

2.3 Programmatic File Manipulation
Using the os and shutil libraries to manage the file lifecycle (Creation -> Modification -> Deletion) ensures that the application has the necessary write permissions in the host environment.

ALGORITHM / IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC

The solution is implemented as a linear, sequential script (os_lab_4_simulation.py) with the following flow:

Initialization: The script defines utility functions for logging to system_log.txt.

Sequential Execution: - task1_process_info() is called to log PID/PPID.

task2_system_stats() is called to dump OS info.

task3_vm_detection() is called to analyze hardware signatures.

task4_file_operations() performs a predefined set of CRUD operations on a test directory.

task5_directory_traversal() builds a temporary tree, walks it, and cleans it up.

Termination: The script exits automatically after the last task, printing a summary.

TEST SCENARIOS AND OUTPUTS

Scenario 1: Execution on Host Machine Action: Run python os_lab_4_simulation.py Expected Output Log:

  OS LAB 4: AUTOMATED SIMULATION


========================================

[Task 1]

System Call: os.getpid() -> 12345

Child Process Spawned... Terminated.

[Task 2]

System: Windows/Linux

Machine: AMD64/x86_64

[Task 3]

Current MAC: 00:05:69:xx:xx:xx

MAC Analysis Result: Virtual Machine (VMware)

[Task 4]

Created directory: lab4_test_dir

[File Content]: Operating System Lab Assignment 4

Renamed os_lab_test.txt to os_lab_final.txt

Cleaning up... Deleted directory.

[Task 5]

Scanning directory structure...

Traversal Complete: Found 2 files in 3 directories.

CONCLUSION

This automated simulation demonstrates the power of Python for Operating System management and auditing.

By removing the interactive menu, the tool can be integrated into startup scripts or cron jobs.

The script successfully identified the environment (Physical vs. Virtual).

It verified file system integrity by successfully performing write and delete operations.

The use of an external log file (system_log.txt) ensures that audit trails are preserved even after the script terminates.
